# Professional Team Generator

## Description
This project runs in the integrated terminal via Node. Once started, the user will choose whether the employee they are adding is a manager, engineer, or intern. They will then be asked specific questions based on their selection. When done building their team, an HTML will automatically generate with an org chart.
